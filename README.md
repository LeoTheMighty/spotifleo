#### *Inspiration*

The inspiration came from when I was younger and would try to go through and discover an artist's
discography and get quickly bored from Spotify's "shuffle artist" feature. Then years down the line
I would try them again and realize I just wasn't listening to the songs that **I liked**, which can
be very different than the artist's most popular songs. So I manually designed a systemic way to go
through an artist's entire discography and create a playlist with only the songs that I liked.
However, in this process I noticed that it was very difficult to both go through all of the songs and
remember where I left off, as well as add these songs to my other playlists. *(like breh if i had 3
playlists i wanted to add a song too it would legitimately take like 15 clicks because of my folder
structure)*. So this is an improvement on that.
